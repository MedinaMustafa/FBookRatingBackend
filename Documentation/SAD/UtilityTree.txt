2.9 EVALUATION SCENARIOS (UTILITY TREE)
 
2.9.1. Detailed Scenario: New Users Can Register and Log In Within 2 Minutes
Profile: Usability
Scenario Weight: High
Description:
This scenario demonstrates the user experience for new customers who want to register for the service and immediately log in. The entire process—from navigating to the registration page, completing the registration, and logging in—should take no more than two minutes to ensure a smooth and satisfying first impression.
Actors:
•	New User: An individual who has never used the system before.
Preconditions:
•	The system is online, and the registration page is accessible.
•	The user is not already registered in the system.
•	Required system resources (e.g., database, authentication service) are operational.
Trigger:
A prospective user visits the website with the intent to create an account and access the service.
Flow of Events:
1.	Navigation:
o	The new user accesses the registration page via the website's home page or a direct link.
2.	Input Registration Data:
o	The user fills in mandatory fields such as username, password, email, and selects a role (user or admin if applicable).
3.	Submission and API Processing:
o	The user submits the registration form.
o	The API Layer receives the request, validates input, and passes the data to the Service Layer.
4.	Business Logic Execution:
o	The Service Layer checks for data integrity, applies business rules (e.g., ensuring unique usernames), and prepares the data for persistence.
5.	Data Persistence:
o	The Data Access Layer stores the new user information in the database and returns a confirmation.
6.	User Confirmation and Redirection:
o	A confirmation message is generated, and the new user is notified via email or an on-screen message.
o	The user is redirected to the login page.
7.	Login Process:
o	The user enters the registered credentials.
o	The API Layer handles the login request, calling the Service Layer for authentication.
o	Upon successful verification, a JWT token is issued, and the user is logged in.
Postconditions:
•	The user’s data is saved in the system.
•	A confirmation (email or on-screen) is sent to the user.
•	The user successfully logs in and gains access to the system.
Non-Functional Requirements:
•	Time Constraint: The entire registration and login process must be completed within 2 minutes.
•	Security: Input validation, password encryption, and secure token generation must be enforced.
•	Reliability: The system must handle concurrent registration attempts without data inconsistency.
Importance:
This scenario is critical for ensuring a positive first interaction with the system. A smooth, quick registration and login process directly impacts overall user satisfaction and the perceived usability of the product.
