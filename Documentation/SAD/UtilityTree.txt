2.9 EVALUATION SCENARIOS (UTILITY TREE)
  

2.9.1. Detailed Scenario: New Users Can Register and Log In Within 2 Minutes
Profile: Usability
Scenario Weight: High
Description:
This scenario demonstrates the user experience for new customers who want to register for the service and immediately log in. The entire process—from navigating to the registration page, completing the registration, and logging in—should take no more than two minutes to ensure a smooth and satisfying first impression.
Actors:
•	New User: An individual who has never used the system before.
Preconditions:
•	The system is online, and the registration page is accessible.
•	The user is not already registered in the system.
•	Required system resources (e.g., database, authentication service) are operational.
Trigger:
A prospective user visits the website with the intent to create an account and access the service.
Flow of Events:
1.	Navigation:
o	The new user accesses the registration page via the website's home page or a direct link.
2.	Input Registration Data:
o	The user fills in mandatory fields such as username, password, email
3.	Submission and API Processing:
o	The user logs in through Auth0, which authenticates the user and issues a JWT token.
o	The client includes this token in the Authorization header when making API requests.
o	Upon receiving a request, the API Layer (Controller):Validates the presence and correctness of the JWT using middleware (AddAuthentication and AddJwtBearer).
o	If the token is valid, the request proceeds to the service.
o	The Business Logic Layer processes the request (e.g., creates a new user or stores a rating) and interacts with the Data Access Layer for persistence.
4.	Business Logic Execution:
o	The Business Logic Layer checks for data integrity, applies business rules (e.g., ensuring unique usernames), and prepares the data for persistence.
5.	Data Persistence:
o	The Data Access Layer stores the new user information in the database and returns a confirmation.
6.	Login Process:
o	The user enters the registered credentials.
o	The Auth0 handles the login request.
o	Upon successful verification, a JWT token is issued, and the user is logged in.
Postconditions:
•	The user’s data is saved in the system.
•	The user successfully logs in and gains access to the system.
Non-Functional Requirements:
•	Time Constraint: The entire registration and login process must be completed within 2 minutes.
•	Security: Input validation, password encryption, and secure token generation must be enforced.
•	Reliability: The system must handle concurrent registration attempts without data inconsistency.
Importance:
This scenario is critical for ensuring a positive first interaction with the system. A smooth, quick registration and login process directly impacts overall user satisfaction and the perceived usability of the product.
