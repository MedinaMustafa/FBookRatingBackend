2.4 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN RATIONALE
Key design decisions include:
•	Three-Layer Architecture:
Chosen for its clear separation of concerns, ease of testing, and future scalability.
•	Modularity:
Inspired by AquaLush, the design anticipates potential evolution toward microservices or CQRS if needed.
•	Security and Performance:
Utilizes Auth0 authentication, *EF Core caching*, and asynchronous operations to ensure high performance and security.
•	Flexibility:
The use of Repository and Unit of Work patterns enables isolated changes without impacting business logic.

2.4.1 Technical Constraints
●	.NET 6+ framework
●	Entity Framework Core for ORM
●	SQL Server database
●	RESTful API design
●	JWT authentication

2.4.2 Quality Requirements
Performance
   - Response time < 50ms for standard operations
   - Support for pagination and lazy loading
Security
   - JWT-based authentication using Auth0
   - Role-based authorization
   - Input validation
   - XSS protection
 Maintainability
   - Modular design
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent coding standards
   - Comprehensive documentation
Scalability
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Caching support
   - Async operations

2.4.3 Scalability Considerations
Current Architecture Adequacy:
- The three-layer architecture effectively serves the current feature set
- Suitable for the existing user base and performance requirements
- Maintains good separation of concerns

Future Scaling Considerations:
- Migration to microservices if specific components need independent scaling
- Implementation of CQRS pattern for complex read/write operations
- Event-driven architecture for better decoupling
- Domain-driven design for complex domain logic
2.4.4  Performance Considerations
Caching Strategy
●	Implementation of response caching
●	Entity Framework second-level cache
●	Distributed caching support (Redis recommended for future scaling)
Optimization Techniques
●	Async/await patterns
●	Efficient querying with proper indexing
●	Pagination implementation
●	Resource compression
●	Query optimization and monitoring

Scaling Strategies
Current Implementation:
●	Vertical scaling capabilities
●	Basic caching mechanisms
●	Connection pooling

Future Considerations:
●	Horizontal scaling preparation
●	Load balancing implementation
●	Database sharding strategy
●	Message queue integration for async operations

2.5.	Architectural Patterns
2.5.1 Repository Pattern

```BookRatingRepository.cs

public class BookRatingRepository<TEntity> : IBookRatingRepository<TEntity> where TEntity : class
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;
    private readonly DbSet<TEntity> _dbSet;

    public BookRatingRepository(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
        _dbSet = context.Set<TEntity>();
    }
    // Implementation
}
```
2.5.2 Unit of Work Pattern

```UnitOfWork.cs

public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;
    private Hashtable _repositories;
    
    // Implementation
}
```



2.6.	Database Architecture
2.6.1 Entity Relationship Diagram
 

2.6.2 Database Design Decisions
1.	Use of soft deletes where appropriate
2.	Audit trails through BaseEntity
3.	Proper indexing strategy
4.	Relationship constraints

2.7.	 Security Architecture
Authentication and Authorization: This application leverages ASP.NET Core Identity, a built-in framework for managing user authentication and authorization.
The ApplicationDbContext class inherits from IdentityDbContext<IdentityUser>, integrating Identity with Entity Framework Core.
Features include user login, registration, password recovery, role-based access control, and more.
2.7.1 Authentication
```Program.cs
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddJwtBearer(options => 
    {
        // JWT configuration
    });
```
2.7.2 Authorization

```BookController.cs
[Authorize]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BookController : BaseApiController
{
    // Protected endpoints
}
```
