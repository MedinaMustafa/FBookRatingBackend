2.2 ARCHITECTURAL MODELS
2.2.1  Architecture Overview
The BookRating system currently implements a three-layer architecture (API, Service, Data Access), which is suitable for the current scope and feature set. However, as the system scales, consideration should be given to evolving towards a more modular architecture such as:
•	Clean Architecture
•	Vertical Slice Architecture
•	Microservices (if warranted by scale and complexity)

2.2.1 API Layer Decomposition
This layer provides the interface for both web and mobile clients.
Example Code:
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class BaseApiController : ControllerBase
{
    // Implementation for request handling and routing.
}

Key responsibilities:
•	Request handling
•	Route definition
•	Response formatting
•	Authentication validation


2.2.2 Service Layer Decomposition
The service layer encapsulates the core business logic for processing book reviews, managing wishlists, and other interactions.
Example Code:
public interface IBookService
{
    Task<IEnumerable<BookReadDTO>> GetAllBooksAsync();
    Task<BookReadDTO> GetBookByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<BookReadDTO> CreateBookAsync(BookCreateDTO bookDto);
    // Additional methods for reviews and wishlists.
}

Key responsibilities:
•	Business logic implementation
•	Data transformation
•	Validation rules
•	Transaction management


2.2.4 Data Access Layer Decomposition
This layer abstracts database operations and ensures consistency through Repository and Unit of Work patterns.
Example Code:
public interface IUnitOfWork
{
    IBookRatingRepository<TEntity> Repository<TEntity>() where TEntity : class;
    Task<int> CompleteAsync();
}

Key responsibilities:
•	Database operations
•	Entity mapping
•	Query execution
•	Transaction coordination
